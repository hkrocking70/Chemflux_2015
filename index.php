								<span class="st-subhead">The Chemical Department of SRM University proudly brings forth the flagship fest of the department Chemflux’15, held from 23rd March 2015 to 25th March 2015. Chemflux’ 15 is the second edition of the much deemed fest that was started in the year of 2014 and has since garnered much attention throughout the city of Chennai and among various colleges and students alike. Chemflux aims at bringing together pupils from different sister branches of Chemical Engineering under one umbrella of knowledge and learning. Chemflux’15 not only aims at promotion of the department of Chemical Engineering but also towards better synchronization among students of various departments like Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biotechnology, Genetic Engineering and Civil Engineering. <br><br>
								Chemflux’15 boasts of a dynamic team working behind it to make it a much bigger success than Chemflux’14 and a bouquet of events to make the goal possible. This year, Chemflux’15 brings two Special Events, one Main Quiz, Panel Discussions, A Workshop, and Poster as well Paper Presentations along with a special section called Industry 911. The three day fest has been planned in a way to let the participants reap the fruits from all the events that are being held at the fest, from titillating Guest Lectures to brain ticking Main Quiz. <br><br>
								The Events planned for Chemflux’15 are sure to create a buzz among the participants as they are sure to test the general as well as the technical knowledge imbibed by the students over the years in Engineering. The Special Events promise to get your gray cells to work, whereas the Panel Discussions will create the much needed awareness among the students. All the students taking part in Chemflux’15 will be presented with a starter kit containing various stationary that will be required during the course of the fest, and as the fest propagates, participants will be presented with their well-deserved prize money and participation certificates.
